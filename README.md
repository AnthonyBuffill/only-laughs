Welcome to ONLY LAUGHS!  

Welcome to ONLY LAUGHS!  

This website is a fun user friendly experience created to provide a spark of fun to your day.

Once you enter our landing page, you will find dynamically styled interface that may even appear a bit nostalgic.
Other than the title that lets you know you've come to the right place, you will notice there are a couple of buttons to interact with.
The first button to the left is labeled "Picture Generator" and beneath that you will find a similiar button labeled "Joke Generator".
Now this is where the fun truly begins...

Upon pressing the Picture generator you will quicky see a picture loaded to the screen thanks to our partnership with Unsplash API. 
By itself this may not seem overly impressive but when you then couple that with clicking the Joke generator button a joke will materialize above the picture thanks to our fun friends the DEV JOKE API whose jokes are all geared towards developers.

Now you have generated in the center of the screen a brand new meme!  

Everyone has a unique sense of humor so from here you have a choice to save this newly generated meme to your "Meme Vault" or continue to follow the previous steps to create a meme that you are more inclined to preserve.

Should you choose to save a generated meme, you will be able to view your creations that you have chosen to save simply by clicking the Meme Vault button that will take you to the MEME VAULT page which contains all of your saved memes. 

From here, you can always push the "go back" button to navigate directly back to the Meme Generator homepage.
And hey if your just here for some random fun and looking to be surprised by what may be generated, simply click the randomizer button and a joke and picture will randomly be chosen from their respective APIs creating a completely random meme!

So please enjoy our website and if you are interested in contacting us, the developers of this site, check out our contacts page by clicking Contacts at the bottom of our landing page.
